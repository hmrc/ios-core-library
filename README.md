## Tools

### fastlane

We use [fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios) to automate tedious tasks such as tagging a new release.

Our fastlane [README](https://github.com/hmrc/ios-core-library/tree/master/fastlane) documents our custom actions.

### SwiftLint

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce Swift style and conventions. Our custom rules can be found in our [.swiftlint.yml](https://github.com/hmrc/ios-core-library/blob/master/.swiftlint.yml).
